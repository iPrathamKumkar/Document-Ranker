Here aux_program is at most one of java, php, python (your choice).

For php or python, IndexPrinter should be either IndexPrinter.php or IndexPrinter.py, respectively

If you choose to do this project in C or C++, aux_program is optional.
Your program will be compiled on a Mac running MacOS High Sierra, having used brew

In the above, rank_method is one of cos or proximity. This should determine

The query is a quoted string of one of more querty terms. For this homework,
two terms are the same if they are the same after stripping punctuation and
putting the terms to lower case. An example of running the program might be:
